    """
    animate_walker(states, guard=nothing, saveAnimation=False)

    # Arguments
    - `state_matrix`: a 14 x N (# timesteps) matrix of states 
        - assume every row looks like [q, q_dot] where
            x, y, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5 = q
            xd, yd, t1d, t2d, t3d, t4d, t5d = qÌ‡
    - 'params': tuple that includes 6 mass weights, 5 link lengths, and gravity constant
    - `guard`: currently a float that represents a slop angle, should probably be a time varying function in the future
    - 'saveAnimation' : boolean that determines whether or not to save a copy of the animation

    # Returns
    Nothing, but produces an animation that can optionally be saved locally
